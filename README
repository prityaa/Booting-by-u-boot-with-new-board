1 . define SYS_VENDOR with new board name in arch/arm/machine_type/Kconfig

	edit "arch/arm/mach-bcm283x/Kconfig" with new board file 
	name added in board file.

2 . Add board specific file in .board/
	board/raspberrypi/rpi

3 . add header file in include/configs/

	include/configs/rpi_new.h

4 . compile and fix other coding error if any. 




Execution of the boot 

1 . for "arch/arm/cpu/arm1176/start.S"  
	1. save_boot_params calls from boards 
	"board/_raspberrypi/rpi/lowlevel_init.S".

	2. start.S calls "lowlevel_init" from  
	"board/_raspberrypi/rpi/lowlevel_init.S".
	
	3. start.S calls "_main" from 
	"arch/arm/lib/crt0.S"
		
		1 . in _main,it calls board_init_f from 
		common/board_f.c
		
		whrer initcall_run_list uses "init_sequence_f"
		init_sequence_f => here only init list of 
		function pointer is defined.
	
		2 . in _main,it calls board_init_r from 
		"common/board_r.c". 

		whrer initcall_run_list uses "init_sequence_r"
		init_sequence_r => here only init list of 
		reset function pointer is defined.
